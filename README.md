# Button Animation with localStorage

This is a simple web project demonstrating how to create smooth CSS animations triggered by user actions, with user preferences stored and retrieved using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **CSS Animation:** A pulse animation applied to a button.
- **User Preference:** Toggle to enable or disable animation.
- **Persistence:** Animation preference is saved in `localStorage` and applied automatically on page reload.
- **Dynamic Behavior:** JavaScript triggers animation on button click if enabled.

## Files

- `index.html` — Main HTML page with the button and toggle checkbox.
- `styles.css` — Contains button styles and CSS keyframe animation.
- `script.js` — JavaScript logic to handle animation triggering and localStorage persistence.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click the **"Click me!"** button to trigger the pulse animation (if enabled).
3. Use the checkbox to enable or disable the animation.
4. The preference will be saved and loaded automatically on future visits.

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

## License

This project is open source and free to use.
